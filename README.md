The entry point into front-end web development.
This repository will be an index documenting my path to re-learning HTML & CSS.

## Web design vs. Web development
Web designers mock up the feel of a website, while web developers write the code to make it happen.
Web designers typically use, Sketch, Figma or Adobe XD.
Web developers typically use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code.

## Good design vs. Bad design
Good design is concise. Bad design is long-winded.
Good design creates a sustainable, trustworthy impression on the user. Bad design creates apprehension.
Good design increases the perceived value of a brand or identity. Bad design decreases it.
