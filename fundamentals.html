    <h3>How to choose a dog</h3>

    <p>
      Define why exactly you want a dog. Before browsing, consider your own health, budget, lifestyle and timing when choosing a dog. 
      If and when everyone in your family is on board, the person spending the most time with the dog makes the decision. 
      When choosing the right dog for you and your family, the primary things to consider are the energy level, age, size and breed. 
      Incredible dogs can be found in shelters as well as private breeders. They can also be mixed or purebred. 
      If you specifically desire the biggest version of the breed, males are <em>usually</em> bigger. 
      Other than that, the sex of a dog should be a miniscule factor. 
      Start your search at

      and 
        
      <a href="https://www.petfinder.com" target="blank"><em>Petfinder</em></a>,
        
      regardless of the breed.

      Most pet stores that sell dogs are from puppy mills. 
      Pay attention to the dog‚Äôs body language and ask the owner/seller a lot of questions.

    <h3>How to speak to a dog</h3>
    
    <p>
      Dogs live to commune with you 
      ‚Äî because of this, any dog of any age can learn new tricks without you taking on a pack leader or dominant persona. 
      Discipline is still necessary, and there are ways to communicate that in ways your dog will understand 
      (i.e. without the aforementioned personas). 
      Your dog is willing to learn how to communicate with you and what the boundaries of your lifestyle are.
      Your primary goal when your dog is first brought home is to bond with them. 
      This is done with exercise, communication and consistency. 
      By doing this, your dog will choose to obey out of love (inside out training), instead of fear (outside in training).

    <h3>How to care for a dog</h3>

    <p>
      Basic care is an expression of love to your dog. 
      Grooming, safety and disaster preparedness ensure that your dog lives a healthy andpropserous life with you for as long as possible.

      </ul>

    <h3>How to teach a dog</h3>

    <p>
      There are two types of training sessions ‚Äî <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>secondary</strong> ones.
      Primary training establishes new behaviors with gradual distractions in a controlled environment. 
      Secondary training is anything outside of this. 
      The words ‚Äùyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù are words your dog will grow to understand undoubtedly well
      ‚Äî the yes meaning that their behavior is appreciated and is to be continued, while the no encourages them to reset and start over again. 
      This chapter also introduces important commands such as ‚Äúleave it‚Äù and ‚Äúlook at me‚Äù as well as others, 
      but the common ground between all of them is building trust with your dog by setting them up for success at every moment. 
      When the both of you are ready, introducing variables such as increased distance, distractions 
      and lapse in time make these commands a bit more challenging.
